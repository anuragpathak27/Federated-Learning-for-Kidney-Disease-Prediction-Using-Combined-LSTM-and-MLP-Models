# Federated-Learning-for-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Using-Combined-LSTM-and-MLP-Models

## Overview
This repository contains the **Google Colab-compatible Jupyter Notebook** for the research paper **"Federated Learning for Kidney Disease Prediction Using Combined LSTM and MLP Models"**, presented at the **14th IEEE International Conference on CSNT 2025**. The project focuses on developing a privacy-preserving kidney disease prediction model using a hybrid of **LSTM** and **MLP** architectures in a **federated learning** setup.

## Features
- **Federated Learning** implementation using simulated clients.
- Combination of **LSTM** (for sequential data handling) and **MLP** (for classification).
- Fully implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ ready for local or Colab execution.
- Emphasis on **data privacy** â€“ no centralized data collection required.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Chronic Kidney Disease EHRs from Abu Dhabi**, available publicly on Kaggle:
